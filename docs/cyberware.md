# Cyberware
## Augmentations
Installed cyberware is typically mechanically represented by Augmentations.  There are many forms of Augmentations, including:

- Augmentations that increase one of a character’s Attributes;
- Neural Processors that allow for bonuses to Skills;
- Operating Systems provide unique powers;
- Merit Augmentations that allow for specialized abilities;
- Weapon Augmentations.

### Attribute Augmentations
**Attribute Augmentations** will cause a character to gain 1 Cyberware Density for each Attribute dot gained.

- Every dot gained through Augmentations in Physical Attributes also grants +1 level of Armor.
- Every dot gained through Augmentations in Social or Mental Attributes also grants +1 level of Willpower.
- Augmentation bonuses to Composure or Resolve still increase maximum Willpower (see **Vampire: the Masquerade: 5th Ed Corebook**, p.___) in addition to the increase mentioned above.
- Attribute Augmentations cannot increase any one Attribute beyond 5 dots. If an Attribute Augmentation would increase an Attribute beyond 5 dots, that Attribute has 5 dots instead.
- If a player wishes to further increase an attribute that already has an Augmentation, the player may choose if they are getting further upgrades to the same piece of cyberware as the former Augmentation or if the increase to their attribute is from a new piece of cyberware.  In either case, the character’s Cyberware Density is increased by the same amount.

Attribute Augmentations are intentionally left nondescript in order to encourage player and Storyteller creativity. 

> Is the Augmentation to your Strength a powerful cybernetic arm, a pair of solid steel hydraulic legs, or something else entirely?  What about a literal silver tongue to augment your Charisma, or audiovisual enhancements which improve your Wits? 

The form that these Augmentations take within your character’s story is completely up to the player and the Storyteller.

| Physical Augmentations | Social Augmentations | Mental Augmentations |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Strength +1<br>Armor +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Charisma +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Intelligence +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 |
| Dexterity +1<br>Armor +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Manipulation +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Wits +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 |
| Stamina +1<br>Armor +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Composure +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 | Resolve +1<br>Willpower +1<br>Cyberware Density +1 |

> Billy’s character has a Strength Augmentation, represented by a mechanical arm, as his sole piece of cyberware.  His character’s Cyberware Density is currently 1. 

> He decides to make two additional Augmentations to his character, installing a Dexterity Augmentation as well as an additional Strength Augmentation.  

> After talking to his Storyteller, he comes to the decision that the Dexterity Augmentation will be represented by a synaptic accelerator installed in his character’s nervous system, and that the additional Strength Augmentation will simply be represented as a further upgrade to his mechanical arm.

> His character’s total Cyberware Density is now 3.

### Neural Processors
Neural Processors are a specialized type of Augmentation which is installed at the base of the skull. 

Neural Processors have a Cyberware Density based on the number of available chip slots they provide, from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. 

For each chip slot, a character may have an active Skill chip installed, which can confer bonuses ranging from as little as +1 to as high as +4.

Changing a chip quickly or on short notice is considered a minor action and requires a Dexterity + Wits test at Difficulty 2.

| Neural Processor | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| Neural Processor Mk. 1 | 1 Cyberware Density; 1 available chip slot; up to +1 bonus |
| Neural Processor Mk. 2 | 2 Cyberware Density; 2 available chip slots; up to +2 bonus |
| Neural Processor Mk. 3 | 3 Cyberware Density; 3 available chip slots; up to +3 bonus |
| Neural Processor Mk. 4 | 4 Cyberware Density; 4 available chip slots; up to +4 bonus |
| Neural Processor Mk. 5 | 5 Cyberware Density; 5 available chip slots; up to +5 bonus |

Storytellers and players are again encouraged to be creative when it comes to Skill chips. 

> A Skill chip which provides a +1 to Brawl may be represented as a series of Tae Kwon Do kicks uploaded directly to the user’s muscle memory, while a Skill Chip with a +4 bonus to Performance could funnel the decades of experience of a master pianist directly to the fingertips of a novice.

### Operating Systems (OS)
Certain Augmentations can provide unique powers to a character, and often those Augmentations and powers can be upgraded or improved. The powers granted by these Augmentations are categorized under an Operating System (OS).

Mechanically, these Operating Systems function almost identically to Disciplines, except for the manner in which they are acquired.

Just like Disciplines (see **Vampire: the Masquerade: 5th Ed Corebook**, p.___), taking a dot in an Operating System allows for the acquisition of one power from that Operating System at a level requirement of equal to or less than the total number of dots in that Operating System.  

The Cyberware Density for Operating System powers is gained at a rate of 1 Cyberware Density per 1 dot in the Operating System acquired.

- Activating an Operating System power may cause the character to take one or more Superficial Willpower Damage (not halved), if the power requires it.
- Some Social and Mental Operating System powers may specify that they only affect targets who also have cyberware installed.
- A character may only have one Operating System installed at a time.

Some Operating System powers allow both vampires and mortals to have access to a Discipline through cyberware (such as the Speedware OS giving characters access to the Celerity Discipline). 

If the standard variant of a cyberware Discipline power would typically require a Rouse check (see **Vampire: the Masquerade: 5th Ed Corebook**, p.___), using that power through cyberware instead causes Superficial Willpower Damage (not halved) equal to the number of Rouse checks that would have been required. 

Discipline powers gained through Augmentations are not cumulative with standard Discipline levels and powers already gained.

> Becky, a vampire, already has 1 dot in Celerity. If she decides to install a piece of cyberware that grants 2 dots in Celerity, she will not now have 3 dots in Celerity. Instead, she will now have two dots of Celerity, with one level one Celerity power through vampirism, one level one Celerity power through cyberware, and one level two Celerity power through cyberware.

#### NeurodeckOS
The **NeurodeckOS** is a small neural implant embedded behind the temples. Tiny contact nodes interface directly with the brain’s neural pathways, allowing the user to access networks, control connected devices, and defend against basic networking attacks.

| Level | OS Power | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Made to Raid | Add this character’s dots in Neurodeck to any roll that includes Technology in the dice pool. |
| Level 1 | Self-ICE | Add this character’s dots in Neurodeck to any rolls to resist malware, viruses, or hacking attempts. This includes any attacks sustained in the Net. |
| Level 2 | Wiretap | Telepathically listen in on phone calls, read forgotten message logs, etc. |
| Level 2 | Everything is Online Nowadays | Temporarily increase any Mental Skill by two dots. |
| Level 3 | CVC (Requires Wiretap) | Successfully hacking into a network lets you see through cameras or cybernetic optics connected to that network. |
| Level 4 | Short-Circuit | A localized overload of a target's system which directly damages electronics, or a portion of the target's cyberware. |
| Level 5 | Overload (Requires Short-Circuit) | An overwhelming overload of a target's system which can disable or damage all of a target's cyberware at once. |
| Level 5 | I'm In | Any test in which the character has Technology in their dice pool is against a difficulty of 1. |

#### SpeedwareOS
The **SpeedwareOS** is a small implant directly embedded in the spine, which interfaces with the user's nervous system. Tiny contact nodes interface directly with the nervous system, allowing the user to move and react with blinding speed.

A character with the Speedware OS has access to Celerity Discipline powers at a rate of 1 dot per 1 Cyberware Density in the Operating System acquired.  For this character, these powers are considered Operating System powers instead.

#### BerserkOS
The **BerserkOS** is a small implant which involves a mix of reflex boosters and temporary limit removal by inhibiting signals sent from nociceptors to the brain.

A character with the Berserk OS has access to Potence Discipline powers at a rate of 1 dot per 1 Cyberware Density in the Operating System acquired.  For this character, these powers are considered Operating System powers instead.

### Merit Augmentations
**Merit Augmentations** are Augmentations which, while useful, are not necessarily powerful enough to warrant an immediate increase in Cyberware Density. 

Merit Augmentations are obtained by spending experience points, just like normal Merits (see **Vampire: the Masquerade: 5th Ed Corebook**, p.___).

| Merit | Dots | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Camouflage | o | Your character has had a light-refractive gloss applied to the surface of their skin. Increase your character’s Stealth Skill by 1. |
| | oo | Your character has had high-grade, light-refractive nanofibers woven into their skin. Increase your character’s Stealth Skill by an additional 1. |
| Internal Agent | oo | Your character gains the ability to make phone calls, send messages, and hail vehicles with just their thoughts. Using this ability causes a glowing effect behind the eyes that can alert another character to your use of this ability as long as they are able to see your eyes (requiring a Wits + Awareness test at Difficulty 2 from the character observing the use of this ability). |
| Optics | o | At a glance, your character can tell exactly what another character’s current Cyberware Density is. |
| | oo | At a glance, you can tell exactly what cyberware a target has installed. |
| Subdermal Implants | o | Your character has had a respectable amount of synthetic armor plating implanted beneath their skin, covering their vital organs. Increase your character’s Armor by 1. |
| | oo | Your character has expanded their subdermal synthetic armor plating to cross their entire body. Increase your character’s Armor by an additional 1. |

You can find the complete list of Merit Augmentations in the [Tables](tables.md#merit-augmentations) section of the sidebar.

### Weapon Augmentations
Weapon Augmentations are cyberware built directly into a character's body to enhance combat capability.

Each weapon augmentation carries a Cyberware Density based on its lethality and the type of damage it deals. Low-level augmentations grant minor bonuses, while heavier, more dangerous implants can significantly increase Cyberware Density. 

Weapon Augmentations may vary in Cyberware Density depending on their range and unqiue capabilities. If developing a custom Weapon Augmentation for a player, in general, follow the following criteria:

- 1 level of Cyberware Density for weapons which deal +1 and +2 Aggravated Damage to mortals and Superficial Damage to vampires.
- 2 levels of Cyberware Density for weapons which deal +3 and +4 Aggravated Damage to mortals and Superficial Damage to vampires.
- 3 levels of Cyberware Density for weapons which deal +1 and +2 Aggravated Damage to vampires or direct Cyberware Damage.
- 4 levels of Cyberware Density for weapons which deal +3 and +4 Aggravated Damage to vampires or direct Cyberware Damage.

You can find the complete list of Weapon Augmentations in the [Tables](tables.md#weapon-augmentations) section of the sidebar.

### Homebrewing Augmentations
Storytellers are encouraged to experiment with their own Augmentations which mimic existing or create new Disciplines, Merits, or Advantages. 

Homebrewed cyberware's Cyberware Density will vary depending on the strength of the Merit itself in the chronicle, and it is left to Storyteller discretion whether the Cyberware Density of a custom piece of equipment needs to be increased at all during the course of the game. 

| Description of Homebrew Cyberware | Cyberware Density |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Weak or niche experimental cyberware | +1 |
| Unremarkable or common experimental cyberware | +2 |
| Reasonably strong experimental cyberware | +3 |
| Very strong experimental cyberware | +4 |
| Powerful or story-altering experimental cyberware | +5 |
